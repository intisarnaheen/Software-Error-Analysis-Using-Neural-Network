# analyzing-software-deep-learning

In this project, deep neural network has been used to train our
model with around 800 javascript programs in the form of sequence
of tokens. What it does is basically train the model with these sequence
of tokens. After training, this model can predict the next
expected token given the previous tokens as input. Based on this
prediction we will verify how effective is the network accuracy to
predict the expected tokens. This project report will discuss all the
important aspects which are closely related to the project. Implemented
approach in section 1 describes briefly about implemented
RNN(Recurrant Neural Network), LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)
and why it has been chosen over other networks. Section 4
will discuss in detail the practical evaluation of the approach including
different cases with correct predictions and where are the
limitations.
